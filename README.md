üåè The **Chinese Web Demo** is avaiable at [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/studios/iic/OmniSearch/summary?header=default&fullWidth=false) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alibaba-NLP/OmniSearch) nowÔºÅ

- We propose OmniSearch, a self-adaptive retrieval agent that plans each retrieval action in real-time according to question solution stage and current retrieval content. As far as we known, **OmniSearch is the first planning agent for multimodal RAG.**
- We reveal that existing VQA-based mRAG benchmarks fail to reflect the feature that real-world questions require dynamic knowledge retrieval, and propose novel **Dyn-VQA dataset, which contains three types of dynamic questions.**
- We **benchmark various mRAG methods** with leading MLLMs on Dyn-VQA, demonstrating their flaw in providing sufficient and relevant knowledge for dynamic questions.

## üí° Perfomance

The performance of various MLLMs with different mRAG strategies are shown below:

# üìö Dyn-VQA Dataset

The json item of Dyn-VQA dataset is organized in the following format:
```json
{
    "image_url": "https://www.pcarmarket.com/static/media/uploads/galleries/photos/uploads/galleries/22387-pasewark-1986-porsche-944/.thumbnails/IMG_7102.JPG.jpg/IMG_7102.JPG-tiny-2048x0-0.5x0.jpg",
    "question": "What is the model of car from this brand?",
    "question_id": 'qid',
    "answer": ["‰øùÊó∂Êç∑ 944", "Porsche 944."]
}
```

üî• The Dyn-VQA **will be updated regularly.** Laset version: 202410.

# üõ† Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

#### Details

- Python = 3.11.9
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (>= 2.0.0)
- pillow = 10.4.0
- requests = 2.32.3
- google-search-results = 2.4.2
- serpapi = 0.1.5

# üíª Running OmniSearch

We have release the code of GPT-4V-based OmniSearch for English questions.

Before running, please replace with your own OPENAI key and Google_search key. OPENAI key is at 11-th line of main.py 

```python
GPT_API_KEY = "your_actual_key_here"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {GPT_API_KEY}"
}
```

Google_search key is at 10-th line of search_api.py

```python
API_KEY = "your api-key"
```

The result is saved to the path:

```python
output_path = os.path.join(meta_save_path, dataset_name, "output_from_gpt4v.jsonl")
```

Run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py --test_dataset 'path/to/dataset.jsonl' --dataset_name NAME --meta_save_path 'path/to/results'
```

# üîç Evaluation

The evaluation script for token F1-Recall of the output answers can be used as follows:

```bash
python evaluate.py --evaluate_file_path [path to output jsonl file] --lang [language of the
 QA dateset: en/zh]
```

## üî• TODO

- Release code for Qwen-VL-Chat based OmniSearch
- Release the corresponding model weight
- Create a benchmark for Dyn-VQA

## üìÑ Acknowledge

- The repo is contributed by Xinyu Wang, Shuo Guo, Zheng Zhang and Yangning Li. 
- This work was inspired by ReACT, SelfAsk, FleshLLMs. Sincere thanks for their efforts.
